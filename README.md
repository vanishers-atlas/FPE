# Introduction

This repo sorts the state of the FPE (FPGE processing element) and related tools development at the time of myself, withdrawing for my PhD on the development of this lean, highly configable softprocessor.

## Tools

All tools how been written in python 3, any non-standard library required to run them are listed below:

* antlr 4 python runtime version 4.7.2


## Branches States

At the time of withdrawal all local branches with uploaded, however all bar master, FINNR, & bnn_work were stale; as FINNR and bnn_work were usecase branchs all working code should have already been pushed to master, however some underdevelopment code may still exist within the stall branchs
