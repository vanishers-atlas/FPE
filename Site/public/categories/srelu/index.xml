      <description>The Goal Between this version of the SReLU neuron FPEA program and the last changes were made to improve the overall program efficiency by reordering instructions in the assembly program as well as using the output from slice P on the DSP slice as an operand to instructions allowing the data to be used two cycles earlier in subsequent instructions than if the data was written to memory.
This work also establishes how resource cost grows when executing ensembles of SReLU neurons.</description>
