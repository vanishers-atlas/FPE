      <description>The Goals This work establishes how the resources allocated for the LIF FPEA program on the FPGA changes when executing 2, 5, 10, 100 or 1000 neurons in an ensemble.
Between this version of the LIF neuron FPEA program and the last changes were made to improve the overall program efficiency by reordering instructions in the assembly program as well as using the output from slice P on the DSP slice as an operand to instructions allowing the data to be used two cycles earlier in subsequent instructions than if the data was written to memory.</description>
