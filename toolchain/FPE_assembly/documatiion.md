# Documentation for FPE.toolchain.FPE_assembly

27/05/2020, Created by Stephen Clarke,

## introduction

As both the config extractor and assembler interact with FPE assembly files. to improve maintainability, the reading and basic correctness checking of FPE assembly files is handled by a set of functions in this folder. There are three main groups of functions:
* interface, functions used by the toolchain to interact with assembly files. For convenience they are automatically imported when FPE_assembly is imported by python
* grammar, functions/fies relating to (used to define, used to generate, or generated by) the antlr4 grammar. The antlr4 grammar is used to perform the most basic FPE assembly syntax checking eg, the correct number of operands given to operations. Currently there is no custom error handling for errors found at this level,
* hypergrammar, functions used to check FPE assembly features that are difficult/extremely verbose to check using the antlr4 grammar. Eg checking for multiple declarations of constants
